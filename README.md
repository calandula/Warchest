# Warchest
 
Hello, this is Warchest-Lite developed by Adri√† Espejo

All the documentation used is in the Documentation folder with an added UML Diagram of the whole architecture implemented

All the source code is in the src Folder

Within the src folder we can see all the classes of all entities in our game plus a folder 'db' that acts as a database in a JSON format. RecordManager.py manages this JSON database.
